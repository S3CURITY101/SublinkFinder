Description: SublinkFinder is a python tool for finding Sublinks
in websites. This tool is the recompile from one liner curl scripts
Instead of just checking one page as most of the tools do, this tool
traverses the website and find all the links and subdomains first.
After that, it starts scanning each and every input on each and every
page that it found while its traversal. It uses small yet effective
payloads to search for Sublinks that can leak some interesting reconnaissance
